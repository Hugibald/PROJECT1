For the Frontend Part of the Bootcamp-Course we were put in groups of 3-4 people to work on a project together.
I was in a Team with two other people.
We had to choose the Team-Leader, if we wanted to use Angular or Vanilla JS and the Project we wanted to do.
The options for Projects were: A) A course Landing-Page, B) An Alumni-Website for CodeFactory or C) A Photographer's Website.
We choose option C, Angular and our leader quickly and got to work.
Communications were really good, since we planned and discussed everything together, either on site, or online.
Furthermore we constantly communicated via Slack.
If we encountered Merge-Problems, we managed to solve them ourselves, without needing to ask one of our Trainers.
We had our Site done quickly and had time to invest time and effort into things we were interested in trying.
So I tried to make the site as accessible as possible, and one of my collegues implemented that grandiously annoying Newsletter-Substcription Popup.
During the whole project I took the role as Problem-Solver, always looking into errors the others encountered, while also taking care of my own tasks.
At the very end, shortly before the presentation I went over every detail again and gave the site the finishing touch and checking for glitches and errors.

What was asked of us for the project?
1) The main viewpoint should be the Portfolio of the Photographer.
2) The site had to have a NavBar.
3) A hero-section on the Home-Page.
4) The Portfolio, as the fokus of the page, to show the customers the work of the photographer.
   We were to find "he best way" to show the photographer's work, which contained more than one topic.
5) The Award-Section was optional, but we were encouraged to add some awards our Photographer has won.
6) A Bio/About page to introduce the Photographer and to gain empathy.
7) Testimonials from other customers.
8) Contact or Register so customers can connect with the Photographer.
9) Social-Media Icons... These won't be linked, though.
10) The website had to be fully responsive and have at least 3 independent pages apart from index (Home).

Since the Project is done with Angular, to run it, follow the instructions below.

# PhotoApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.17.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
